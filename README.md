# Project Summary

In this project, we embarked on an analysis journey to understand the performance of four major technology stocks: Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX). Our goal was to provide insights into their investment potential by examining their risk and return profiles. Here's a breakdown of what we did:

## Data Collection and Preparation

We started by gathering historical stock data, including opening and closing prices, highs and lows, adjusted closing prices, and trading volumes. This comprehensive dataset allowed us to analyze the stocks' behavior over time.

## Analysis

### Daily Returns
We calculated the daily returns for each stock to understand their day-to-day fluctuations. Daily returns show how much the value of a stock changes in a day, which is crucial for assessing its volatility and potential for profit (or loss).

### Risk and Return
Next, we focused on two key metrics:
- **Average Daily Return**: This measures the average gain or loss of a stock on a daily basis, providing a sense of how much an investor can expect to earn from the stock daily.
- **Risk (Standard Deviation)**: This statistic helps us understand the volatility of each stock. A higher standard deviation means the stock's price is more spread out over a range of values, indicating higher risk.

Using these metrics, we created a visual representation (a scatter plot) to compare the risk and return profiles of the four stocks. This visualization helps in easily identifying which stocks are more volatile and which offer higher returns.

## Insights

- **Apple (AAPL)** emerged as a relatively safe bet, showing the lowest risk among the four, coupled with a positive average daily return. This suggests that Apple might offer stable and consistent returns as an investment.
- **Google (GOOG)** displayed higher volatility than Apple and a slightly negative average daily return, indicating it might be a riskier and less rewarding investment during the analyzed period.
- **Microsoft (MSFT)** presented a moderate risk but the highest average daily return, hinting at a potentially more rewarding investment, albeit with increased volatility.
- **Netflix (NFLX)** was found to be the most volatile and least rewarding, with the highest risk and a negative average daily return, making it the least attractive investment among the four based on our analysis.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we've provided a foundational analysis of four major tech stocks, focusing on their risk and return profiles. This analysis can help investors make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance and investment goals. Remember, while historical data can offer valuable insights, it's important to consider other factors such as market conditions, company news, and economic indicators before making investment decisions.
